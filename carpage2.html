                            The Audi A3 is a small family/subcompact executive car produced since 1996.[1][2] The first two generations of A3 were based on the Volkswagen Group A platform, which they share with several other models such as the Audi TT, Volkswagen Golf, Volkswagen Caddy, and Volkswagen Touran, as well as SEAT León, SEAT Toledo, and Škoda Octavia. The third-generation A3 uses the Volkswagen Group MQB platform.

                            Adding a bit of visual appeal is a new colour combo. The Etna Orange body colour with a Sonic Silver roof makes the Nexon stand out from the crowd but is available only in the top-end XZA+ variant. There are no changes on the inside, and the cabin continues to offer a premium ambience.

                        The 718 was a development of the successful Porsche 550A with improvements being made to the body work and suspension. The car is a RennSport build with a wheelbase shorter (German 'Kurz') than typical of predecessors of the era and this led to the car being referred to as the RSK.

                        The Hyundai i10 is a city car produced by the South Korean manufacturer Hyundai since 2007. It replaced the Hyundai Atos in the model lineup, and is available only with a five door hatchback body style. The second generation of the car was presented in August 2013 and released in the beginning of 2014. A slightly larger version, developed for the Asian market, was released in September 2013 as the Grand i10.

                        The basic design is based on the Mahindra Armada Grand. The first-generation Bolero was equipped with a Peugeot 2.5 L (150 in3) IDI engine which produced 75 bhp (56 kW).[citation needed] The second generation was released with slightly modified exteriors (a larger grille being the most obvious change) and the major change was the engine, a 2.5 L (150 in3) in-house engine from Mahindra.

                        The Tata Nano is a city car manufactured by Tata Motors made and sold primarily in India. The Nano was initially launched with a price of one lakh rupees or ₹100,000 (US$1,500) which has increased with time. Designed to lure India's burgeoning middle classes away from motorcycles, it received much publicity, but the sales expectations were not met.
